// CONCLUSION : 
// As "ptr" is a "constant pointer to a constant integer" - we cannot change the value stored at address "ptr" AND 
// We cannot change the value stored at address "ptr" AND We cannot change the 'ptr' (Address) itself.
// We cannot also also change the "value at address ptr" - we cannot change the value of "number" with respect to "ptr" =>(*ptr)++ is NOT allowed
// We cannot change the value of 'ptr' => That is we cannot store a new address inside 'ptr' => So, ptr++ is also NOT allowed.
